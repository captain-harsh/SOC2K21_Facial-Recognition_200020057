# SOC2K21_Facial-Recognition_200020057

Task 1(A1): Pandas exercises

Basic functions of pandas and numpy and methods to extract specific data from a given dataset. This introduced us to the basics of reading data, counting rows and columns, checking datatypes and refinig the data to gain both unique and not available entries.

Task 2(A2):Matplotlib exercises
We got insight into Matplotlib and how we can compute various types of statistical data and draw graphs(histograms and box-and-whiskers). Learnt how to calculate mean,mode,skew, min, max, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and inter-quartile range using python. It also made us to experiment with the histogram bins which was pretty new for me.


Task 3b(A1): Seaborn Plotting


Task 4(A1): Live Age and Gender Detection
using the pre trained caffe model at https://github.com/pydeveloperashish/Age-and-Gender-Recognition learnt how computer vision can be used to predict gender and age of a person.
Learnt various new technicalities of opencv and learnt how to use a pre trained model


Task 5(A1): Age and Gender Detection on YouTube Videos
This was a insightful task and helped me review all the app development aspects I learnt recently and even introduced to certain new features of app development. The git I used https://github.com/tensorflow/examples

Task 7(C2): Making colab based face detection+recognition+cluster project:
I learnt a lot from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/about.For eg what is deep metric learning, encoding faces usong Opencv and deep learning, how to recognize faces from images, recognizing faces from videos and much more using Davis King’s dlib library and Adam Geitgey’s face_recognition module which wraps around dlib’s deep metric learning, making facial recognition easier to accomplish. Overall this was the most engaging task of the entire project and though it took some time processing all the information this was the best task.
